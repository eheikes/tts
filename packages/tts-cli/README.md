# Text-To-Speech CLI

Command-line tool to convert a text file of any size to speech using [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) or [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/).

![Animation of the tool in action](docs/tts-cli.gif)

## Requirements / Installation

* [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org) v14+
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
* An Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account

You can then install the package globally:

```
$ npm install tts-cli -g
```

You'll also need to set up your computer:

* AWS Polly: [Get your AWS access keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html) and [configure your machine with your credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html).
* Google Cloud Text-to-Speech: [Create and set up a Cloud Platform account](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/text-to-speech/latest/#quickstart) and [download your credentials file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#obtaining_and_providing_service_account_credentials_manually).

## Usage

```
$ tts [inputfile] outputfile [options]
```

Example:

```
# Using a text file as the input, changing the default voice, and specifying the AWS keys.
$ tts test.txt test.mp3 --voice Brian --access-key ABCDEFG --secret-key hwl500CZygitV91n

# Using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
$ tts test.txt test.mp3 --service gcp --language en-US

# Passing a string of text as the input.
$ echo "Hello world! How are you?" | tts test.mp3
```

Standard arguments:

* `inputfile` is the text file you want to convert to speech. It should be encoded as UTF-8. If excluded, tts-cli will read in the text from `stdin`.
* `outfile` is the filename to save the audio to.

Service options:

* `--access-key KEY` -- AWS access key ID
* `--email EMAIL` -- GCP client email address (required if `private-key` or `private-key-file` is used)
* `--private-key KEY` -- GCP private key
* `--private-key-file FILE` -- GCP private key file (`.pem` or `.p12` file)
* `--project-file FILE` -- GCP `.json` file with project info
* `--project-id ID` -- GCP project ID (e.g. `grape-spaceship-123`)
* `--secret-key KEY` -- AWS secret access key
* `--service TYPE` -- Cloud service to use (`aws` or `gcp`) (default `aws`)
* `--throttle SIZE` -- Number of simultaneous requests allowed against the API (default `5`)

Audio options:

* `--effect ID` -- Apply an audio effect profile. Can be specified multiple times.
* `--ffmpeg BINARY` -- Path to the ffmpeg binary (defaults to the one in PATH)
* `--format FORMAT` -- Target audio format (`mp3`, `ogg`, or `pcm`) (default `mp3`)
* `--gain GAIN` -- Volume gain, where `0.0` is normal gain
* `--gender GENDER` -- Gender of the voice (`male`, `female`, or `neutral`)
* `--language LANG` -- Code for the desired language (default `en-US` for GCP, no default for AWS)
* `--lexicon NAME` -- Apply a stored pronunciation lexicon. Can be specified multiple times.
* `--pitch PITCH` -- Change in speaking pich, in semitones
* `--speed RATE` -- Speaking rate, where `1.0` is normal speed
* `--region REGION` -- AWS region to send requests to (default `us-east-1`)
* `--sample-rate RATE` -- Audio frequency, in hertz. See the [API docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_SynthesizeSpeech.html#polly-SynthesizeSpeech-request-SampleRate) for valid values.
* `--type TYPE` -- Type of input text (`text` or `ssml`) (default `text`)
* `--voice VOICE` -- Voice to use for the speech (default `Joanna` for AWS).

Note that not all services support all options. For example, AWS Polly does not understand the `speed` option. See the [options documentation](docs/options.md) for more info.

## What It Does

* Splits the text into the maximum size allowed by the API (1500 characters for AWS, 5000 characters for Google Cloud).
* Compresses the white space inside the text to minimize the cost.
* Uses your credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` (AWS) or the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (Google Cloud) file.
* Calls the API (in a throttled manner) to get each text part converted to audio.
* Combines the audio together into a single file.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure Node.js is working. Running `node --version` on the command line should give a version of v10.0.0 or higher.
* Make sure ffmpeg is installed. Running `ffmpeg -version` on the command line should give you the version information.
* Make sure you can connect to AWS or Google Cloud normally.
  * Going to https://polly.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/speech (or whatever AWS region you're using) should give you a "Missing Authentication Token" message. You can use the [AWS CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to check your configuration -- installing that and running `aws sts get-caller-identity` should return your user info.
* Run `export DEBUG=*` first (Linux or Mac) to turn on debugging output. On Windows you'll need to use `set DEBUG=*` (command prompt) or `$env:DEBUG = "*"` (PowerShell).
